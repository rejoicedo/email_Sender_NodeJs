# Email Sender NodeJs

Sending Automated Mails from my NodeJs App to my Gmail Account
I used Nodemailer(An email sender package in NodeJs).
NOTE: All files were uploaded manually

1. A contact form was created for which an individual can send his details
2. A bulk messaging system was applied, whereby i am able to send mail to more than 1 person.

Below is the mail sent to my gmail account from my form

ERRORS I ENCOUNTERED
*(contact.handlebars) was not later used in my program due to some errors i encountered. (contacts.ejs) was later used.
*Was not able to push the node_modules folder due to some git issues
*Had to hide the .env file cause it contails crucial and relevant informations



THANKS TO THE ZURI TEAM FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT, IT HAS TRULY BEEN OF HELP TO ME.
